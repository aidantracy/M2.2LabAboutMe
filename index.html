  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Name: Aidan Tracy</li>
    <li>Graduates: Fall 2025</li>
    <li>I do not currently have a job doing Web Development, but I would like to get better at this so I can do freelance work on the side!</li>
    <li>I do not have an internship or experience in web design and development. I currently work fulltime for a local bank as a fraud investigator. At the moment I am on a paternity leave for 16 weeks because we were blessed with our baby boy, Archie :) I am working on acquiring an internship during this time. </li>
