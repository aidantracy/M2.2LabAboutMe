# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is a basic "about-me" landing page. I have been watching a lot of ink masters where I drew my inspiration to do a "neon" color theme. 

This led me down a rabbit hole of creativity in terms of trying to implement transitions and transforms. I learned that you can do multiple layers in a single transition line of code to help give it that blurry neon look. 

I struggled with trying to find information about QUnits and trying to understand how they work on the outside. I think hooks are little above my head at the moment but I am trying to learn them to implement them in the future. The documentation provided helped a little bit but I did find a neat resource on youtube that didn't just help me with QUnit testing but also other aspects of development that pertains to other classes. 

I found that the alert() function doesn't seem to work while using live preview in vs code, however it sort of does when it is pushed to an actual browser instead. Looking "under the hood" using developer tools while in the browser, it appears that the alert() function was being ignored every time it was being called. ChatGPT had to help me here and suggested that I make a popup modal instead. The chatGPT generated code is cited within the project. 

## Running This Project
If you had followed the setup for this lab, you are already half way there. You will need to have node.js installed as well as live preview from the vs code extensions. 

To run this project, on the left hand side under Explorer, right click on the index.html and select "show preview" or "run live server". This will open another tab on the right hand side of your VS Code IDE that displays my simple about me page. 

From first glance you will notice that everything is in neon green. Try hovering over everything. For the "click me" button, try clicking and holding that click and then releasing after about 2 seconds to see what it does!
